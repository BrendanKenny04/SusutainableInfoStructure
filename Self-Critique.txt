If i had more time, I would really have liked to think more about colors for the text and backgrounds. I would also have liked to think more about including the icons (not in the repo because they were unused), figuring out how to put them nicely into the nav specifically. Another thing I would want to do is make the text work better in smaller windows. I feel like with more time I probably could have optimized the css file (its ridiculous how many separate elements I have listed by ID because I couldn't think of a better way). I would want the whole thing to look more like the aside element with a nice border and background. I also want to make the case studies in the research document more like asides, but i couldnt think of a way that wouldnt be overwhelming.
